## Automating Ticket Creation

With Spike’s Playbooks, you can automate ticket creation on your helpdesk platforms whenever an incident is triggered. This saves time and ensures no incident goes unnoticed.

## Manual Ticket Creation

Once connected, any team member can send incidents or sync them with your helpdesk platform:
- **From the Dashboard**: Select one or more incidents and link them to tickets.
- **From the Incident Page**: Open the incident and choose to create or sync with a helpdesk ticket directly.
