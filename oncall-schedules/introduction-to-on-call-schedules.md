# Introduction

## What is On-call?

On-call is making sure there are one or more persons responsible to be alerted on all incidents and outages. A person will be on-call for a period of time who sole responsibility to listen to alerts and respond to incidents. This is relatively an old concept, we are getting inspired from doctors and firefighters.&#x20;

**Example:** At any given point in time, there will be one or more doctors at the Emergency room in a hospital when the patient arrives. These doctors are "on-call". For a critical patient, a doctor can help instantly and if need be, they can escalate to others to attend to the patient.&#x20;

Similarly, your team can have at least one person on-call for a set period of time to respond to critical incidents, to say the least.&#x20;

A person will either be on-call or not. You cannot "create" on-call. You will create schedules for who will be on-call.

### What is an On-call schedule?

Schedules determine who is/will be on-call. You can create a flexible schedule, one that works for everyone and add team members to it. Schedules will make sure to rotate the members on daily, weekly or even custom time intervals.&#x20;

Anyone with more than one team member.&#x20;

### 2. Who can create schedules?

Admins and members can both create and edit schedules. Use fine-grained access control to manage on-call permissions

### **3. Does being on-call mean ALL the alerts will come to me?**

No, you can choose which escalation policy alerts an on-call user would receive.&#x20;
