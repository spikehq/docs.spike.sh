# Roles and access

## Roles
Checkour roles and access under [Organisation > Team](https://app.spike.sh/settings/general/team). Every member in your team will be assigned a role and every role will have a pre-defined set of permissions that admins can edit. 

By default, these are the different roles available:

| Role      |  Desc                                                                                           |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Admin     |  Admins have full access to manage this account with the added ability to remove people as well |
| Manager   |  Managers can manage all entities on this account. They can change people's permissions and roles |
| Responder |  Deals with incidents, integrations, automation, on-calls, etc but they cannot archive/delete any entity  |
| Viewer    |  Viewers have read-only permissions across the spectrum on Spike. They can't create, update, or delete |

Click on the roles above to see who has a given role.

## Access control
Access control mainly revolves around who can create, edit, delete or archive integrations, incidents, on-call schedules and so on. 

You can click on `View & edit permissions` to see and alter each member's permission.

## FAQs

### How to edit control for a user?
Click on `View & edit permissions` for a user and then change the role for what seems fit.

### I don't see a role fit a user, what should I do?
Best to create a new role. Yes, that's possible. On the teams page, click on Create role. In this section, create a new role with whatever permissions you would like to give and then assign the user the newly created role.

{% endhint %}

### How do I remove a user?
Click on the remove icon next to the user's info in the table to remove a user. However, make sure that you replace them from escalation policies and on-call schedules too.
