# Cooldown & Deep work mode
Both modes were designed with responder well-being in mind, offering much-needed breaks and uninterrupted work time. By allowing responders to rest or focus without being constantly alerted, these modes support better mental clarity and reduce alert fatigue.

While these modes currently operate independently, we may consider grouping them into a unified "Do Not Disturb" mode in the future. The goal is to give responders the flexibility to control when and how they receive alerts without sacrificing incident response quality.



## Deep Work Mode

Deep Work Mode is intended for responders who need uninterrupted time for focused work. When enabled, this mode temporarily suppresses all non-critical incident alerts (except SEV1) for either 4 or 8 hours. These options are preset and cannot be edited. During this time, you can focus on your work without the distraction of lower-severity alerts.

You will receive critical incident (SEV1) alerts.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Setup on desktop" %}
* Access the dropdown from the header that says `Select a mode` 
* Enable **Deep Work Mode** for either 4 or 8 hours with a single click.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Cooldown Mode

Cooldown Mode is designed for responders who need a break after handling incidents, such as an overnight shift. This mode pauses all alerts for either 12 or 24 hours, depending on the option selected. During this period, responders will not receive any incident alerts, allowing them to rest and recharge.

You will receive critical incident (SEV1) alerts.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Setup on desktop" %}
* Access the dropdown from the header that says `Select a mode` 
* Select **Cooldown Mode** for either 12 or 24 hours with a single click.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
