# Out of office
Heading out of the office? You can schedule or instantly set up **Out of Office**, so your duties including on-call responsibilities and incident alerts are covered by a colleague.

Out of Office mode is designed to support better work-life balance. **While you're away, Spike will not send you any alerts**. You can even schedule this ahead of time, and an email will be sent to the admins in your organization, keeping everyone informed.

## Offloading Duties
When setting up Out of Office, you can offload your responsibilities to a selected team member. Spike takes care of everything automatically—there’s no need to manually move members in the on-call schedule or add overrides. Your on-call shifts and incident alerts will be temporarily rerouted to the designated member.

Although optional, we recommend offloading your duties to make sure incidents are addressed in your absence and you are not disturbed.
