# Alerts during office hours
Customize how you receive alerts during office hours, whether for incident triggers or resolutions. If you’re working at your desk, you might prefer to route all SMS alerts to the [mobile app](../mobile-app-alerts.md) for better accessibility. Field engineers may prefer to continue receiving alerts via [SMS](../sms.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
On-call shift start/end alerts remain unaffected. If an incident occurs during your on-call shift within office hours, alerts will be sent according to your configured settings.
{% endhint %}

### Set up
