# Alerts during office hours
Customize how you receive alerts during office hours, whether for incident triggers or resolutions. If youâ€™re working at your desk, you might prefer to route all SMS alerts to the [mobile app](../mobile-app-alerts.md) for better accessibility. Field engineers may prefer to continue receiving alerts via [SMS](../sms.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
On-call shift start/end alerts remain unaffected. If an incident occurs during your on-call shift within office hours, alerts will be sent according to your configured settings.
{% endhint %}
