# Alerts during office hours
During office hours, you can route alerts for when incident triggers or resolves. If you work at your desk then you would perhaps choose to route all SMS alerts to [mobile app notification](../mobile-app-alerts.md). Field engineers can opt to get them on [SMS](../sms.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
On-call alerts for your shift start/end will not be affected. If incidents trigger during your on-call shift in office hours, alerts will be routed based on your configuration.
{% endhint %}
