# Personal Alert Management

Spike provides a range of options to customize how you receive incident alerts. These settings allow you to tailor your alert preferences for office hours, out-of-office hours, and when incidents are triggered/resolved, so you have better control over your work-life balance.

With these settings, Spike helps you manage alerts in a way that suits your schedule. When you're out of office, Spike will stop sending alerts, allowing you to step away confidently. Be sure to reassign responsibilities to another team member when you're off duty.

### Example Alert Configurations:

- **During office hours**: Route all phone call alerts to app notifications.
- **Outside office hours**: Prefer receiving alerts via SMS, WhatsApp, or Telegram.
- **Out of office**: Forward all alerts to another team member.

These configurations are especially useful if you've spent extended periods responding to incidents or being on-call, giving you more flexibility and reducing alert fatigue.
