## Get Slack alerts from Spike

[Our Slack app](https://slack.com/apps/AKRF4KSG5-spike) is continuously updated to make sure you have the best experience with alerts so you and your entire team can stay on top of incidents.

You can choose to **acknowledge** or **resolve** an incident directly from Slack.&#x20;

## Installing the app

Once you have signed up, visit the [Alerts section](https://app.spike.sh/settings/organisation) inside your settings and click on **Add to Slack.** Our Slack app asks for some basic permissions. You can choose any channel you wish in the permissions sections.

While creating escalation policies, you can select any of your **public and private channels** for Slack to send incident alerts on.

## Auto-updating Slack messages

If any number of Slack alert(s) been sent for a new incident and you managed to resolve it from either Phone, SMS, Email or Dashboard or if the incident was automatically resolved, then the **Slack message with automatically reflect the resolved state** killing ambiguity on the status of an incident.&#x20;

If an incident has not been resolved automatically on Slack and you decide to resolve it yourself then our Slack app will inform you of the incident already being resolved.&#x20;
