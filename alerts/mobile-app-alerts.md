## Setup
To receive notifications on your mobile device, make sure to set up phone notifications within your escalation policies. This will trigger mobile app alerts delivered directly to your phone, enabling you to respond promptly to incidents.

## Critical alerts
For iOS users, Spike's mobile app offers the option to receive Critical notifications (partnered with Apple) for critical incidents or for all incidents. This feature ensures that you never miss an important notification, even if your device is on Do Not Disturb mode. You can find this setting within the app under notification preferences.
