# Integrate Spike with GitHub Workflows
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Github workflows integration.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Overview
[GitHub Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows) allows you to create custom workflows that automate your software development processes. Whether it's building, testing, or deploying your code, GitHub Workflows streamlines your CI/CD pipeline and ensures your projects stay on track.

##

By integrating GitHub Workflows with Spike, you can receive real-time alerts for various workflow-related incidents, including:

* **Workflow Failures:** Alerts when a workflow run fails, helping you quickly identify and address issues in your CI/CD pipeline.
* **Job Failures:** Notifications for individual job failures within a workflow, allowing for targeted troubleshooting.
* **Run Time Exceeds:** Alerts when a workflow or job takes longer than expected, indicating potential performance bottlenecks.

This integration ensures that youâ€™re promptly informed of any issues in your workflows, enabling fast response and resolution.

Auto-resolution is supported for this integration. Spike will also automatically group repeated incidents and suppress alerts while incident is open.
