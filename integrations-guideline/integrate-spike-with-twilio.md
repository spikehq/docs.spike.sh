# Integrate Spike with Twilio
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/integrations/twilio/twilio-cover.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

[Twilio](https://twilio.com) provides cloud communication services for messaging, voice, and more. It also offers tools like Debugger and Usage Triggers to monitor usage spikes, errors, and anomalies in your Twilio account.

With Spikeâ€™s integration, you can receive real-time alerts for Twilio events, such as:

* **Usage Triggers:** Alerts for predefined usage thresholds (e.g., sudden spikes in API usage or spending).
* **Debugger Alerts:** Notifications for issues identified by Twilio's Debugger tool.

This integration enables your team to respond immediately to critical events and usage patterns in your Twilio services.

{% hint style="info" %}
Spike will automatically group repeated incidents and suppress alerts while an incident is open. You can set up [alert rules](https://docs.spike.sh/alerts/alert-rules) to control incident severity and customize actions. Auto-resolution is not supported.
{% endhint %}
