<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Cronitor integration.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Overview
[Cronitor.io](https://cronitor.io) is a monitoring tool designed to track the health and performance of your scheduled jobs, uptime, and heartbeat signals. Set up this integration to get instantly phone call and other alerts when things go wrong.

### Incident Alerts from Cronitor.io

With Spikeâ€™s integration, you can receive real-time alerts for various incidents monitored by Cronitor.io, including:

* **Uptime Monitoring**: Alerts when your websites or services go down, ensuring prompt response to minimize downtime.
* **Cron Job Monitoring**: Notifications when scheduled jobs fail to run, take too long, or run at unexpected times.
* **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Alerts when expected heartbeat signals from your services or applications are missed, indicating potential failures or issues.

This integration allows you to stay on top of any disruptions in your scheduled jobs, uptime, and heartbeat signals, ensuring quick action and resolution.

Auto-resolution is supported for this integration. Spike will also automatically group repeated incidents and suppress alerts while incident is open.
