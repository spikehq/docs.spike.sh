# Styling your Status Page

Visit [themes](https://statuspage.spike.sh/themes) from sidebar to access to begin. You can customize your status page to align with your brand and design preferences. You can control everything from the header and footer to the colors and images to give a more seamless, on-brand experience when checking the status of your services.

### Header Customization

In the header, you can customize the color, add a logo, and even include links to other parts of your website. This helps provide a consistent navigation experience for your users, while keeping your brand front and center.

### Cover Image and Color

The cover section of your status page can be fully tailored to your preferences. You can:
- Add a cover image to match your branding.
- Customize the cover section’s background color.
- Hide the cover image if you prefer a minimalist look.

### Footer Customization

The footer is another area where you can apply your branding. Here, you can:
- Add custom links.
- Include social media icons for easy access.
- Display your copyright information to make the page feel professional and complete.

### Main Components and Historical Uptime

For the core components that appear on your status page, you can choose whether or not to display historical uptime data. Showing uptime history can provide more transparency to your users, but you also have the option to hide it if that suits your needs better.
